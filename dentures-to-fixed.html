                    <h2>You Don't Have to Live with Dentures Anymore</h2>
                    <p>If you wear dentures, you already know the daily frustrations: the slipping, the adhesives, the dietary restrictions, the constant worry. You've probably been told "this is just what having dentures is like" or "you'll get used to it."</p>
                    
                    <p>But here's the truth: <strong>there is a better way.</strong></p>

                    <p class="emphasis">Full arch dental implants can replace your removable dentures with permanent, fixed teeth that look, feel, and function just like natural teeth. No more adhesives. No more embarrassment. No more compromises.</p>

                    <h2>The Reality of Living with Dentures</h2>
                    <p>Let's be honest about the challenges you face every day:</p>

                            <ul class="check-list red">
                                <li>Avoiding social situations and meals out</li>
                                <li>Limited food choices (no steak, apples, or crusty bread)</li>

                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p style="margin-top: 2rem;">If you're nodding along as you read this, you're not alone. Thousands of people in Bournemouth and across Dorset are dealing with these same issues every single day.</p>

                    <h2>Why Dentures Never Feel Right</h2>
                    <p>It's not your fault dentures are uncomfortable. The problem is fundamental to how dentures work:</p>

                    <div class="info-box warning">
                        <h4>The Denture Problem</h4>
                        <p>Dentures rest on top of your gums. As your jawbone continues to shrink (which happens when teeth are missing), your dentures become increasingly ill-fitting. This creates a vicious cycle:</p>
                        <ul style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                            <li>Bone loss → Dentures fit poorly → More movement and pressure → Accelerated bone loss</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">No matter how well dentures are made initially, they can never provide the stability of teeth that are anchored directly into your jawbone. And no amount of adhesive can fix this fundamental issue.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>The Solution: Fixed Teeth on Dental Implants</h2>
                    <p>Full arch dental implants offer a permanent alternative to dentures. Instead of resting on your gums, your new teeth are supported by dental implants that are integrated directly into your jawbone.</p>

                    <h3>How It Works</h3>
                    <p>We place 4-6 dental implants into your jawbone (a procedure known as "All-on-4" or "All-on-6"). These implants act like artificial tooth roots, providing a stable foundation. A complete set of fixed teeth is then attached to these implants.</p>

                    <p>The result? Teeth that are:</p>
                    <ul class="check-list green">
                        <li><strong>Permanently fixed</strong> – They never come out</li>
                        <li><strong>Rock solid</strong> – No movement or slipping</li>
                        <li><strong>Fully functional</strong> – Bite, chew, and eat anything you want</li>
                        <li><strong>Natural looking</strong> – Beautifully designed to match your facial features</li>
                        <li><strong>Long-lasting</strong> – Can last 20+ years with proper care</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Am I Too Old for Dental Implants?</h2>
                    <p>Absolutely not. Age is rarely a barrier to dental implants. We regularly treat patients in their 60s, 70s, 80s, and beyond.</p>

                    <p>What matters is:</p>
                    <ul class="check-list green">
                        <li>Your general health (most common health conditions are not a problem)</li>
                        <li>Sufficient jawbone (even if you've worn dentures for years, we can usually work with what you have)</li>
                        <li>Your desire to improve your quality of life</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="emphasis">If you're healthy enough to have a tooth extracted, you're likely healthy enough for dental implants. At 70 or 80, you could still have 10-20+ years to enjoy fixed teeth. Why not make them the best years possible?</p>

                    <h2>What About Bone Loss?</h2>
                    <p>Many denture wearers worry they've lost too much bone for implants. Here's the good news: the All-on-4 and All-on-6 techniques were specifically designed for people with significant bone loss.</p>

                    <div class="info-box">
                        <h4>All-on-4: Designed for Bone Loss</h4>
                        <p>The All-on-4 technique angles the implants to maximize contact with existing bone and avoid areas with insufficient bone. This means even patients who have worn dentures for 20+ years are often suitable candidates without bone grafting.</p>
                        <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">During your free consultation, we'll take a 3D scan to assess your bone and determine the best approach for your specific situation.</p>

I'd tried multiple dentures but nothing worked because of bone loss. The All-on-4 technique was perfect for my situation. The implants are rock solid. For the first time in 15 years, I can chew properly and speak clearly. The investment was significant, but when I think about my remaining years and how much this has improved my daily comfort, it was absolutely worth it."</p>

                    <div class="info-box">
                        <h4>20-Year Comparison</h4>

                        </ul>

                    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

                    <h3>Will I be without teeth during treatment?</h3>
                    <p><strong>No.</strong> You'll receive provisional fixed teeth on the same day as your implant surgery. You'll never go without teeth.</p>

                    <h3>Is the procedure painful?</h3>
                    <p>The procedure is performed under local anaesthetic, so you won't feel pain during surgery. Most patients report minimal discomfort afterwards, easily managed with over-the-counter pain relief. Many say it's far more comfortable than they expected.</p>

                    <h3>How long does it take?</h3>
                    <p>The total process takes 4-6 months from consultation to final teeth. However, you'll have fixed provisional teeth from the day of surgery, so you're enjoying life without dentures from day one.</p>

                    <h3>Can I still get implants if I've worn dentures for 20+ years?</h3>
                    <p>Most likely, yes. The All-on-4 and All-on-6 techniques are designed specifically for patients with bone loss from long-term denture wear. A free consultation with 3D imaging will determine your suitability.</p>

                    <h3>Do I have to go to London or overseas?</h3>
                    <p>No. We bring advanced expertise to Bournemouth. You can have advanced care close to home, with all the convenience and support of a local practice.</p>

                    <h3>What if something goes wrong?</h3>
                    <p>Dental implants have a >95% success rate. In the rare event of a complication, we're here to address it. Your treatment plan includes comprehensive aftercare and support.</p>
