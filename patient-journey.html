                    <p>We understand that considering full arch dental implants is a big decision. One of the best ways to feel confident is to know exactly what to expect at every stage.</p>
                    
                    <p>This guide walks you through the entire process, from your very first phone call to your long-term care. We believe transparency removes anxiety and helps you make informed decisions.</p>

                    <p class="emphasis">The typical timeline from consultation to final teeth is 4-6 months, though you'll leave surgery with a beautiful provisional smile the same day.</p>
