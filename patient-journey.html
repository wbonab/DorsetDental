                    <h2>Stage 3: Treatment Planning</h2>
                    <p><strong>Duration: 1-2 weeks</strong></p>
                    <p>Once you decide to proceed, we begin detailed treatment planning:</p>

                    <ul class="benefit-list">
                        <li><strong>Digital Smile Design:</strong> Using software, we design your new smile based on your facial features and preferences</li>
                        <li><strong>Surgical Planning:</strong> We determine the exact position, angle, and depth of each implant</li>
                        <li><strong>Temporary Teeth Creation:</strong> We fabricate your temporary fixed teeth to be fitted on surgery day</li>
                        <li><strong>Pre-operative Appointment:</strong> Review your treatment plan, answer final questions, and prepare for surgery</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Stage 4: Surgery Day</h2>
                    <p><strong>Duration: 2-4 hours per arch</strong></p>
                    <p>This is the day you've been waiting for. Here's exactly what happens:</p>

                    <h3>Before Surgery</h3>
                    <ul class="benefit-list">
                        <li>Arrive at the practice (we recommend bringing someone to accompany you home)</li>
                        <li>Complete any final paperwork</li>

                        <li>Local anaesthetic is administered—you'll be completely numb and comfortable</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>During Surgery</h3>
                    <p>The procedure follows these steps:</p>
                    <ol style="line-height: 1.8;">
                        <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Any remaining teeth that need extraction are removed</li>
                        <li><strong>Implant Placement:</strong> 4-6 implants are placed using guided surgery techniques for precision</li>
                        <li><strong>Immediate Teeth:</strong> Your temporary fixed bridge is attached to the implants</li>
                        <li><strong>Final Checks:</strong> We ensure everything fits properly and comfortably</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>Throughout the procedure, you're kept comfortable and informed. Most patients are surprised by how straightforward it is.</p>

                    <h3>Immediately After Surgery</h3>
                    <p>You'll leave the practice with your new fixed teeth in place. You'll receive:</p>
                    <ul class="benefit-list">
                        <li>Detailed aftercare instructions</li>
                        <li>Pain medication and antibiotics if needed</li>

                        <li>Follow-up appointment scheduled</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Stage 5: Initial Recovery</h2>
                    <p><strong>Duration: 1-2 weeks</strong></p>

                    <h3>First 24-48 Hours</h3>
                    <ul class="benefit-list">
                        <li>Rest at home—take it easy</li>

                        <li>Take prescribed medications as directed</li>
                        <li>Avoid strenuous activity</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>First Week</h3>
                    <ul class="benefit-list">
                        <li>Swelling and bruising are normal and will subside</li>
                        <li>Stick to soft foods (mashed potato, soup, yoghurt, scrambled eggs)</li>
                        <li>Gently clean your teeth as instructed</li>
                        <li>Most patients return to work after 3-5 days</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Week 2 Onwards</h3>
                    <ul class="benefit-list">
                        <li>Gradually introduce more normal foods</li>
                        <li>Swelling should be mostly resolved</li>
                        <li>Continue with good oral hygiene</li>
                        <li>Attend your 2-week check-up</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Stage 6: Healing Period</h2>
                    <p><strong>Duration: 3-6 months</strong></p>
                    <p>During this phase, your implants are integrating with your bone—a process called osseointegration. This creates the strong foundation for your final teeth.</p>

                    <h3>What to Expect:</h3>
                    <ul class="benefit-list">
                        <li>You'll wear your comfortable temporary fixed teeth</li>
                        <li>Gradually return to normal eating (avoiding very hard foods)</li>
                        <li>Attend periodic check-ups (typically at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, and 3 months)</li>
                        <li>Your temporary teeth may be adjusted for optimal comfort</li>
                        <li>By month 3, you'll feel completely normal</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Life During Healing</h3>
                    <p>Most patients adapt quickly to their temporary teeth. You can work, socialize, and live normally. Many people report that even the temporary teeth feel better than their dentures ever did.</p>

                    <h2>Stage 7: Final Teeth Fitting</h2>
                    <p><strong>Duration: 2-3 appointments over 2-4 weeks</strong></p>
                    <p>Once your implants have fully integrated, it's time for your permanent teeth.</p>
