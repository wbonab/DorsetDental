                <h2>Assessment Determines the Right Path</h2>
                <p>Not every patient requires full arch treatment. Our focus is on matching intervention to clinical need—whether that means targeted implant placement for early tooth loss or comprehensive rehabilitation when multiple teeth have failed.</p>

                    <h3>Full Arch Implant Rehabilitation</h3>
                    <p>When multiple teeth have failed or dentures are no longer viable, full arch treatment provides a fixed, stable foundation. This is where planning matters most—implant positions, bone grafting decisions, and prosthetic design are mapped digitally before surgery begins.</p>

                    <p>For patients ready to transition from removable dentures to permanently fixed implant-supported restorations. Requires radiographic assessment of bone anatomy, realistic expectation-setting, and commitment to maintenance protocols.</p>

                    <p>Early intervention when one or several teeth are lost prevents bone deterioration and avoids the need for more extensive treatment later. Assessment clarifies whether targeted placement is appropriate or whether a more comprehensive approach is indicated. Straightforward cases are often managed within our wider practice structure.</p>

                <h2>Why Planning Comes First</h2>
                <p>Implant treatment isn't one-size-fits-all. The difference between a predictable outcome and an uncertain one lies in how thoroughly the case is assessed and how carefully treatment is matched to clinical reality.</p>

            <div class="why-grid">
                <div class="why-card">
                    <h3>Prosthodontic Training & Implant Focus</h3>
                    <p>Dr Will Bonab has completed postgraduate prosthodontic training with a focused interest in implant-led rehabilitation. This background informs treatment planning for both straightforward and complex cases, ensuring intervention is scaled appropriately.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="why-card">
                    <h3>Assessment Before Commitment</h3>
                    <p>Initial consultations include clinical examination and radiographic imaging to determine what level of intervention is indicated. You'll understand whether your situation requires targeted implant placement or full arch rehabilitation—and why.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="why-card">
                    <h3>Digital Surgical Planning</h3>
                    <p>CBCT scans and planning software map implant positions, angulations, and prosthetic outcomes before surgery. This is standard for complex full arch cases and available for targeted implant placement where anatomy requires it.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="why-card">
                    <h3>Comfortable with Complexity</h3>
                    <p>Our practice focuses on cases where planning, surgical experience, and prosthodontic understanding make the difference. Full arch rehabilitation, bone grafting protocols, and immediate loading decisions are managed in-house.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="why-card">
                    <h3>Transparent Pricing</h3>
                    <p>Comprehensive full arch implant treatment typically costs £25,000 per arch. Targeted implant solutions vary depending on the number of implants and prosthetic complexity. Written treatment plans with itemised costs are provided following assessment.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="why-card">
                    <h3>Right-Sized Treatment</h3>
                    <p>Not every case requires full arch intervention. We'll tell you if targeted implant placement is more appropriate, if timing needs to be reconsidered, or if your expectations need adjusting before proceeding.</p>

                <h2>The Treatment Pathway</h2>
                <p>Whether your case requires targeted implant placement or comprehensive full arch rehabilitation, the process begins with diagnostic assessment and ends with long-term maintenance planning.</p>

                    <h3>Initial Assessment</h3>
                    <p>Clinical examination, radiographic imaging, and discussion of your concerns. We determine what level of intervention is indicated and whether full arch treatment, targeted implants, or a different approach makes the most sense.</p>

                    <h3>Diagnostic Planning</h3>
                    <p>CBCT scans reveal bone anatomy in three dimensions. Digital planning determines implant positions, identifies grafting requirements, and maps prosthetic design. The extent of planning depends on case complexity.</p>

                    <h3>Surgical Phase</h3>
                    <p>Implants are placed using guided surgery where indicated. For full arch cases, provisional fixed restorations are typically provided the same day. Targeted implant cases may involve delayed or immediate loading depending on clinical conditions.</p>

                    <h3>Integration Period</h3>
                    <p>Implants integrate with bone over three to six months. Full arch patients wear provisional fixed teeth throughout. Targeted implant patients may have temporary restorations or healing caps, depending on the protocol used.</p>

                    <p>Once integration is confirmed, definitive restorations are fabricated and fitted. For full arch cases, this involves custom-designed fixed bridges. For targeted implants, individual crowns or bridges are delivered.</p>
