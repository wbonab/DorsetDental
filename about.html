                    <h2>Meet Dr Will</h2>
                    
                    <p>Dr Will is a GDC registered dentist with a focused interest in dental implants and advanced restorative dentistry. His practice is dedicated to helping patients achieve stable, functional, and natural-looking teeth through comprehensive implant treatment.</p>
                    
                    <p>Having graduated with Honours from King's College London Dental Institute, one of the UK's leading dental schools, Dr Will is currently undertaking postgraduate prosthodontics training at Harvard School of Dental Medicine. His training emphasises full-mouth rehabilitation, implant-supported restorations, and full-arch treatment — the foundation of modern implant dentistry.</p>

                    <h2>Training & Expertise</h2>
                    
                    <h3>Academic Foundation</h3>
                    <p>Dr Will's journey began at King's College London, where he developed a strong foundation in restorative and surgical dentistry. Graduating with Honours reflects both academic achievement and clinical capability — qualities that continue to define his approach to patient care.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Advanced Prosthodontics Training</h3>
                    <p>Currently pursuing advanced prosthodontics training at Harvard School of Dental Medicine, Dr Will focuses on the complex planning and execution of full-mouth dental rehabilitation. This training covers:</p>
                    
                    <ul class="check-list green">
                        <li>Full-arch implant planning and design</li>
                        <li>Digital treatment planning and guided surgery</li>
                        <li>Implant-supported prosthetics</li>
                        <li>Occlusion and bite management</li>
                        <li>Complex restorative cases</li>
                        <li>Aesthetic and functional integration</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>Surgical Training</h3>
                    <p>Dr Will has completed structured surgical training in dental implant placement, including digital planning workflows and computer-guided surgery. This dual competency — in both surgery and restoration — means he oversees every aspect of your implant journey, from initial planning to final teeth.</p>
                    
                    <div class="emphasis">
                        By managing both surgical placement and final restoration, Dr Will ensures continuity, precision, and a cohesive treatment plan designed around your specific needs — not a one-size-fits-all approach.
                    </div>

                    <h2>Philosophy of Care</h2>
                    
                    <p>Dr Will's approach is defined by three principles: <strong>precision, planning, and patience.</strong></p>
                    
                    <h3>Precision</h3>
                    <p>Every case is approached with meticulous attention to detail. From initial diagnostics to final delivery, accuracy and quality guide every decision. Digital planning, careful execution, and thorough follow-up ensure predictable, long-lasting results.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Planning</h3>
                    <p>Treatment is planned from the end result backwards. Before any surgery, Dr Will designs your final teeth — considering aesthetics, function, bite, and long-term stability. The surgical plan then supports this vision, ensuring implants are placed in ideal positions for the teeth you'll wear for decades.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Patience</h3>
                    <p>Dental implant treatment is a journey, not a quick fix. Dr Will takes time during consultations to understand your concerns, explain options clearly, and ensure you feel comfortable with every decision. There is no pressure, no rush — just thoughtful, transparent guidance.</p>

                    <h2>What Patients Value</h2>
                    
                    <div class="why-grid" style="margin: var(--spacing-md) 0;">

                            <h4>Calm, Considered Consultations</h4>
                            <p>Patients appreciate the unhurried, thoughtful nature of consultations. Every question is answered, every option is explained, and every decision is made together.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="why-card">
                            <h4>Clear Communication</h4>
                            <p>No jargon, no confusion. Dr Will explains treatment in plain English, using visuals and digital planning to show exactly what to expect.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="why-card">
                            <h4>Comprehensive Oversight</h4>
                            <p>From consultation to final teeth, you see the same dentist. This continuity ensures accountability, consistency, and a personal relationship throughout your care.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="why-card">

                            <p>Every case is unique. Dr Will designs treatment around your anatomy, your concerns, and your goals — not a standardised protocol.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="why-card">

                            <h4>Long-Term Focus</h4>
                            <p>Implant treatment isn't just about getting new teeth — it's about maintaining them for life. Dr Will's training and approach prioritise long-term stability and success.</p>

                    <h2>Why Full Arch Implants?</h2>
                    
                    <p>Dr Will's focused interest in full-arch rehabilitation stems from the profound impact this treatment has on patients' lives. Many people who seek full-arch implants have struggled with failing teeth, uncomfortable dentures, or years of dental problems. The transformation isn't just cosmetic — it's functional, emotional, and life-changing.</p>
                    
                    <p>Full-arch treatment requires a unique combination of surgical skill, prosthetic expertise, and careful planning. It's one of the most complex areas of implant dentistry, and it's where Dr Will has chosen to direct his training and focus.</p>

                    <h2>Our Approach at Bournemouth Dental Implants</h2>
                    
                    <p>This practice was founded on a simple principle: <strong>considered treatment, delivered with care, and designed to last.</strong></p>
                    
                    <p>We are a dedicated dental implant practice. Unlike general dental practices that offer implants as one of many services, implant rehabilitation is our sole focus. This specialisation means:</p>

                    <p>Patients choose us not because we're the cheapest or the fastest, but because they value quality, transparency, and a thoughtful approach to a significant investment in their health and wellbeing.</p>
