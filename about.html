                    <h2>Welcome to Bournemouth Dental Implants</h2>
                    <p>We are a specialist dental implant practice dedicated to one thing: transforming lives through advanced full arch implant rehabilitation. Unlike general dental practices that offer implants as one of many services, this is our sole focus and passion.</p>
                    
                    <p>Our practice was founded on a simple belief: that people deserve access to world-class prosthodontic expertise without travelling to London or going overseas. We bring Harvard-level training and specialist care to Bournemouth and the wider Dorset community.</p>

                    <p class="emphasis">Every member of our team is committed to providing exceptional clinical care in an environment that prioritizes your comfort, dignity, and long-term success.</p>

                    <h2>Our Principal Clinician</h2>
                    <p>Our practice is led by a prosthodontist with advanced training from Harvard School of Dental Medicine, one of the world's most prestigious dental institutions.</p>

                    <h3>What is a Prosthodontist?</h3>
                    <p>A prosthodontist is a dental specialist who has completed additional years of training beyond general dentistry, focusing specifically on restoring and replacing teeth. Think of prosthodontics as the architectural and engineering side of dentistry—we specialize in designing and implementing complex full-mouth rehabilitations.</p>

                    <p>While general dentists can place implants, prosthodontists are trained to handle the most complex cases, including:</p>
                    <ul class="check-list green">
                        <li>Full arch implant rehabilitation (All-on-4, All-on-6)</li>
                        <li>Complex bite reconstruction</li>
                        <li>Aesthetic smile design</li>
                        <li>Management of compromised or failing dentitions</li>
                        <li>Treatment planning for extensive reconstruction</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Harvard Training: What It Means for You</h3>
                    <p>Harvard School of Dental Medicine is consistently ranked among the top dental schools globally. Their prosthodontics program is renowned for:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Evidence-based approach:</strong> Treatment decisions are based on the latest peer-reviewed research, not trends or anecdotal evidence</li>
                        <li><strong>Rigorous clinical training:</strong> Extensive hands-on experience with complex full arch cases</li>
                        <li><strong>Multidisciplinary collaboration:</strong> Working alongside specialists from periodontics, oral surgery, and other fields</li>
                        <li><strong>Advanced biomaterials science:</strong> Deep understanding of how implants and materials interact with bone and tissue</li>
                        <li><strong>Digital dentistry leadership:</strong> Early adoption and mastery of 3D planning and guided surgery</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>This training means you benefit from techniques and standards of care developed and refined at one of the world's leading academic medical centers.</p>

                    <h3>Professional Credentials & Memberships</h3>
                    <ul class="check-list green">
                        <li>Advanced Certificate in Prosthodontics, Harvard School of Dental Medicine</li>
                        <li>General Dental Council (GDC) Registration</li>

                    </ul>

                    <h2>Our Philosophy of Care</h2>
                    <p>We believe that excellent clinical outcomes require more than just technical skill—they require listening, partnership, and genuine care for each patient's unique situation.</p>

                    <h3>We Listen First</h3>
                    <p>Before we talk about treatment, we take time to understand your story. What brought you here? What are your concerns? What does success look like for you? Your goals guide every decision we make.</p>

                    <h3>Education, Not Sales</h3>
                    <p>You'll never experience high-pressure sales tactics here. Our role is to educate you about your options, answer your questions honestly, and support you in making the decision that's right for you—even if that means referring you elsewhere or recommending a different treatment approach.</p>

                    <h3>Transparency Always</h3>
                    <p>We believe you deserve complete transparency about:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>What to expect at every stage of treatment</li>
                        <li>Realistic outcomes and potential complications</li>
                        <li>All costs involved, with no hidden fees</li>
                        <li>The evidence supporting our recommendations</li>
                        <li>Our own limitations—we won't take on cases beyond our expertise</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Long-Term Partnership</h3>
                    <p>We're not interested in one-time transactions. We're building long-term relationships with our patients. Your success after treatment is just as important to us as the surgery itself. We'll be here for you—for maintenance, for adjustments, and for peace of mind—for as long as you need us.</p>

                    <h2>Our Technology & Facility</h2>
                    <p>We've invested in advanced technology to provide the most precise, comfortable, and predictable treatment possible.</p>
