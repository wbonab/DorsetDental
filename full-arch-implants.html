                    <h2>What Are Full Arch Dental Implants?</h2>
                    <p>Full arch dental implants are a revolutionary solution for people who are missing most or all of their teeth in the upper or lower jaw (or both). Rather than replacing each tooth individually, full arch implant treatment uses just 4-6 strategically placed dental implants to support a complete set of fixed, permanent teeth.</p>
                    
                    <p>This treatment is often called "All-on-4" or "All-on-6" depending on how many implants are used. The implants act as strong, stable anchors that are surgically placed into your jawbone. Once healed, they fuse with the bone and provide a permanent foundation for your new teeth.</p>
                    
                    <p>Unlike removable dentures, full arch implants are fixed in place. They look, feel, and function just like natural teeth. You can eat, speak, smile, and live your life with complete confidence.</p>

                    <p class="emphasis">While dentures are removable appliances that rest on your gums, full arch dental implants are permanently fixed to implants integrated into your jawbone. This fundamental difference means implants provide superior stability, function, and long-term oral health benefits.</p>

                    <h2 id="failing-teeth">Treatment for Failing Teeth</h2>
                    <p>Many patients come to us with teeth that are loose, painful, infected, or failing due to advanced gum disease or severe decay. In these cases, trying to save individual teeth may not be practical or in your best long-term interest.</p>
                    
                    <p>Full arch implant treatment offers a complete "reset" for your oral health. We can:</p>
                    <ul class="check-list green">
                        <li>Remove severely compromised teeth that are causing pain or infection</li>
                        <li>Eliminate chronic dental problems</li>
                        <li>Replace your entire arch with strong, permanent implant teeth</li>
                        <li>Restore your smile, function, and confidence in a single comprehensive treatment</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>This approach is often more cost-effective, less invasive, and more predictable than attempting multiple individual tooth-saving procedures that may ultimately fail.</p>

                                <p>On your surgery day, we'll place your dental implants using a minimally invasive technique. If you have any remaining teeth that need removal, we'll do this at the same time. Once your implants are in place, we immediately attach a provisional (temporary) set of teeth.</p>

                                <p>Over the next 3-6 months, your implants will integrate with your jawbone through a natural process called osseointegration. During this time, you'll wear your provisional teeth, allowing you to eat, speak, and smile normally while your implants heal.</p>

                    <p>Most patients are surprised by how comfortable the recovery process is. Here's what you can expect:</p>
                    
                    <h3>Immediate Post-Surgery (Days 1-3)</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Some swelling and mild discomfort (easily managed with over-the-counter pain relief)</li>
                        <li>Soft food diet recommended</li>
                        <li>Most patients return to work within 2-3 days</li>
                        <li>Your provisional teeth are in place and functional</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>First Two Weeks</h3>

                        <li>Gradually introduce more foods</li>
                        <li>Follow-up appointment to check healing</li>
                        <li>Resume normal activities</li>
                    </ul>

                    <div class="info-box warning">
                        <h4>Important Note</h4>
                        <p>While full arch implant surgery is generally well-tolerated, all surgical procedures carry some risks. These include infection, nerve damage, implant failure, and complications related to anaesthesia. Your dentist will discuss these risks with you in detail during your consultation. Individual results and recovery times vary.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>Longevity & Maintenance</h2>
                    <p>Full arch dental implants are designed to be a long-term solution. With proper care, they can last 20 years or more—often for the rest of your life.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Daily Care</h3>
                    <p>Caring for your implant teeth is similar to caring for natural teeth:</p>
                    <ul class="check-list green">
                        <li>Brush twice daily with a soft toothbrush</li>
                        <li>Use interdental brushes or water flossers to clean around implants</li>
                        <li>Avoid smoking (it can compromise implant success)</li>
                        <li>Maintain a healthy diet</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>Professional Maintenance</h3>
                    <p>Regular visits to our practice (typically every 6 months) allow us to:</p>
                    <ul class="check-list green">
                        <li>Professionally clean your implants and teeth</li>
                        <li>Check for any signs of complications</li>
                        <li>Make any necessary adjustments</li>
                        <li>Ensure your bite remains balanced</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p class="emphasis">With diligent home care and regular professional maintenance, full arch dental implants have an excellent long-term success rate, with clinical studies showing survival rates above 95% at 10 years.</p>

                    <h2>Pricing Overview</h2>
                    <p>The cost of full arch dental implants varies depending on several factors, including:</p>

                        <li>Number of implants required (All-on-4 vs All-on-6)</li>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How long does the treatment take?</h3>
                    <p>The entire process typically takes 3-6 months from consultation to final teeth. However, you'll receive provisional teeth on the same day as your surgery, so you're never without teeth.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Is the procedure painful?</h3>
                    <p>The procedure is performed under local anaesthesia, so you won't feel pain during surgery. Most patients report minimal discomfort afterwards, easily managed with over-the-counter pain relief. Many are surprised by how comfortable the process is.</p>

                    <h3>Am I too old for dental implants?</h3>
                    <p>Age is rarely a barrier. As long as you're in reasonable general health, you can benefit from dental implants. We successfully treat patients in their 70s, 80s, and beyond.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What if I don't have enough bone?</h3>
                    <p>The All-on-4 and All-on-6 techniques are specifically designed to work even with reduced bone volume. In some cases, bone grafting may be required, but many patients with bone loss are still suitable candidates. A consultation with a 3D scan will determine your options.</p>

                    <h3>Can I eat normally with full arch implants?</h3>

                    <h3>How do I clean my implant teeth?</h3>
                    <p>You brush and floss them much like natural teeth. We'll provide specific instructions and may recommend special brushes or water flossers to keep the areas around your implants clean. Regular professional cleanings are also important.</p>

                    <h3>What's the success rate?</h3>
