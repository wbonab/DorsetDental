                    <h3>Factors That Affect Your Investment</h3>
                    <p>Several factors influence the final cost of your treatment:</p>

                    <div class="info-box">
                        <h4>1. Number of Implants</h4>
                        <p><strong>All-on-4:</strong> Four implants per arch. Suitable for most cases with adequate bone.<br>
                        <strong>All-on-6:</strong> Six implants per arch. Provides additional stability and may be recommended for certain cases.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="info-box">
                        <h4>2. Tooth Extractions</h4>
                        <p>If you have remaining teeth that need removal, this is included in your treatment plan. The number and complexity of extractions may affect the overall cost slightly.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="info-box">
                        <h4>3. Bone Grafting</h4>
                        <p>Most patients do not need bone grafting with the All-on-4 or All-on-6 technique. However, in cases of significant bone loss, minor grafting may be required: <strong>£500-£2,000 per site</strong> if needed.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="info-box">
                        <h4>4. Final Teeth Material</h4>
                        <p><strong>Acrylic Teeth:</strong> Included in base price. Durable, aesthetic, easily repairable.<br>
                        <strong>Hybrid Acrylic/Metal:</strong> +£2,000-3,000. Stronger framework with natural-looking teeth.<br>
                        <strong>Zirconia (Premium):</strong> +£5,000-8,000. Highest strength and aesthetics, stain-resistant.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="info-box">
                        <h4>5. Sedation Options</h4>
                        <p><strong>Local Anaesthetic:</strong> Included in base price.<br>
                        <strong>IV Sedation:</strong> +£500-800. Recommended for anxious patients or complex cases.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>Understanding the Value</h2>
                    <p>While dental implants require an upfront investment, it's important to compare them to the lifetime cost and ongoing limitations of alternatives:</p>

                    <div class="comparison-table">
                        <table>
                            <thead>

                                    <th>Option</th>

                                </tr>
                            </thead>

                                <tr>

                                <tr>

                                </tr>
                                <tr>

                                    <td>£15,000-25,000</td>
                                    <td>20+ years</td>
                                    <td>£15,000-25,000 (typically lasts lifetime)</td>
                                </tr>
                            </tbody>
                        </table>
                    </div>

                    <p class="emphasis">Full arch dental implants typically last 20+ years with proper care. Many patients never need replacement, making them the most cost-effective long-term solution when you factor in replacements, repairs, and quality of life.</p>

                    <h2>Finance Options</h2>
                    <p>We understand that the upfront cost of dental implants can be significant. That's why we offer flexible payment plans to make your treatment more accessible.</p>

                    <h3>0% Interest Finance</h3>
                    <p>For qualified patients, we offer 0% interest payment plans over 12 months. This means you can spread the cost of your treatment with no additional charges.</p>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> A £18,000 treatment becomes £1,500 per month for 12 months with no interest.</p>

                    <h3>Extended Payment Plans</h3>
                    <p>We work with leading healthcare finance providers to offer longer-term payment plans up to 60 months, making treatment affordable for more budgets.</p>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> A £20,000 treatment can be spread over 5 years at approximately £400 per month (interest rates apply, subject to credit approval).</p>

                        <h4>Important Information About Finance</h4>
                        <p>Finance is subject to status and affordability checks. Terms and conditions apply. You must be 18 or over and a UK resident. Missing payments can affect your credit rating. Finance is provided by our partner lenders. Representative APR varies depending on the plan chosen.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>Is Dental Implant Treatment Tax Deductible?</h2>
                    <p>Dental implants are generally not tax-deductible in the UK, as they're typically considered a private medical expense rather than a business expense. However, if you're self-employed and can demonstrate that improved appearance is essential for your business, you may be able to claim a portion. We recommend consulting with your accountant for specific advice.</p>

                    <h2>Insurance Coverage</h2>
                    <p>Most NHS and standard dental insurance plans do not cover full arch dental implants, as they're considered cosmetic or elective rather than medically necessary (even though they provide significant health benefits).</p>
                    <p>However, some private dental insurance plans offer partial coverage. We recommend:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reviewing your policy carefully</li>
                        <li>Contacting your insurer to ask about implant coverage</li>
                        <li>Asking if they cover any portion (consultation, imaging, etc.)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We're happy to provide any documentation your insurance company requires.</p>

                    <h2>Comparing Prices: Why Choose Quality</h2>
                    <p>You may find cheaper dental implant offers elsewhere, particularly from overseas clinics or corporate chains. We encourage you to research thoroughly and understand what's included.</p>

                    <div class="info-box">
                        <h4>What to Look Out For</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Hidden costs:</strong> Some advertised prices don't include imaging, provisional teeth, or final teeth</li>
                            <li><strong>Inexperienced clinicians:</strong> Full arch implants require specialist training</li>
                            <li><strong>Low-quality materials:</strong> Cheaper implants may have lower success rates</li>
                            <li><strong>Limited aftercare:</strong> What happens if something goes wrong?</li>
                            <li><strong>Overseas treatment:</strong> Travel costs, time off work, and difficulty with follow-up care</li>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Why do dental implants cost so much?</h3>
                    <p>The cost reflects specialist expertise, surgical precision, high-quality materials, advanced technology, and comprehensive care over several months. You're paying for a solution that can last 20+ years.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can I pay monthly?</h3>
                    <p>Yes. We offer 0% interest plans over 12 months and extended payment plans up to 5 years to make treatment affordable.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Is the consultation really free?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, completely free with no obligation. You'll receive a full examination, 3D scan, and detailed treatment plan with pricing.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Are there any hidden costs?</h3>
                    <p>No. The price we quote includes everything from consultation through to final teeth and aftercare. What we quote is what you pay.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What if I can't afford the full amount?</h3>
                    <p>We offer flexible finance plans to spread the cost. During your consultation, we'll discuss options that fit your budget.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Do you offer payment plans for people with poor credit?</h3>
                    <p>We work with multiple finance providers who consider applications on a case-by-case basis. We'll help you explore all available options.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can I use my dental insurance?</h3>
                    <p>It depends on your policy. Most NHS and basic plans don't cover implants, but some private plans offer partial coverage. Check with your insurer.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What's the difference between your prices and cheaper overseas options?</h3>
                    <p>Our prices include specialist expertise, premium materials, comprehensive aftercare, and local convenience. Overseas treatment often has hidden costs (travel, time off, follow-up difficulties) and may use less experienced clinicians or lower-quality materials.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Do I pay upfront or at the end?</h3>
                    <p>We offer flexible options. You can pay a deposit to secure your treatment date, with the balance due before or on your surgery day, or use one of our finance plans.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What happens if something goes wrong after treatment?</h3>
                    <p>All necessary follow-up care in the first year is included. If complications arise due to the treatment, we'll address them at no additional cost. Your treatment plan will detail our warranty terms.</p>
